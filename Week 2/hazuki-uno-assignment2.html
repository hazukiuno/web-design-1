                Q. What will be the primary content of your site?</p>
            <p>
                The primary content of my site will be images of my works. I will have separate pages for each category of my works like illustration works, paintings, video works, and animations. I will have menu bar to lead the user to each page easily. These will create a clear site with good accessibility. Each page will have images that are the thumbnail of images of my work and when the user clicks on an image, the image becomes bigger. I would like to have a hover on the thumbnails so that when the user sees it they know the title of my works.

                Q. What will be the secondary content?
            </p>
            <p>
                As the secondary content, I will have about page, and contact page. I will include an image of me in about page so that the employers know how I look like. Also, I will include a brief description of myself and social media links in that page. For contact me page, I will have a place where the users can write anything and will automatically send it to my email address.

                Q. How will users navigate through your site?
            </p>
            <p>
                 I would like this site to have good accessibility for any kind of users. By having thumbnails with images of my work, which the user can click on to, it will have clear and simple navigation. When the user is viewing my work, I would like it to be easy to go to the next image and also easy to go back to the main page by having icons to navigate the user. I would also like to have illustrated icons of different social medias on my about page. The language that I will be using in this site is formal, however, I would like the site to look more playful.
